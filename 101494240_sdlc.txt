DevOps plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams. It introduces automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, which reduce the time-to-market for software products while maintaining high quality.

By integrating DevOps into the SDLC, organizations can identify and resolve issues earlier in the development process, minimize downtime, and enhance system reliability. This approach promotes agility, scalability, and faster feedback loops, making it essential for modern software development in a competitive digital landscape.
