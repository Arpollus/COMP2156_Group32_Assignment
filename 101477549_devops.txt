Personal Reflection
I truly value how this course integrates technical tools with the cultural mindset 
required for DevOps implementation. COMP 3104 has been instrumental in introducing me to 
GitHub Actions, making workflows and automation more comprehensible. Prior to this, I had 
no experience with GitHub, so it has been a great learning opportunity.
